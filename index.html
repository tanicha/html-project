            <p id="ms">I grew up loving computers. During some of my middle school days, we would go to the computer labs for our class time, and I was always excited to be in a room full of technology. Fast forward a million years, I was able to create a successful pathway for myself into the field of tech. I made my career somewhere I would be working in a room with great technology. </p>

                    <h2>Tani Cha</h2>
                    <p>Hi, my name is Tani Cha. I was born and raised in Washington. I am currently a Software Engineer Apprentice at Expedia Group. I hope to continue to grow my current skillset of different programming languages. I am a very highly motivated individual with a big dream of giving back to the ones I love. My key motivation to succeeding is my family, especially my mother. My goal is to create a better life for her as well as travel around the world with my family to see all the different, amazing cultures and their amazing food! I also love to swim! I swam when I was younger for about 4+ years and really enjoyed being in the water. Another hobby of mine is playing video games! My favorite game of all time would definitely have to be COD/BO2; definitely a classic and brings up great memories from my childhood.  </p>
